# openvpn-client-builder

Builds of [dperson/openvpn-client](https://github.com/dperson/openvpn-client).

These builds exist so that I can have version-tagged images (the official ones only have `latest`). The tags are based on the openvpn version.

If you don't need version tags you should use the `latest` [official build](https://hub.docker.com/r/dperson/openvpn-client).
